## System Architecture

1. **Data Collection:**

   - Use Q-GIS for manual labeling.
   - Process geospatial data with GDAL.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Augment images (rotations, flips) using OpenCV.
   - Ensure geospatial consistency with GDAL.

3. **Model Training:**

   - Prepare and normalize image data.
   - Design and implement custom CNN models in TensorFlow.

4. **Classification for Specific Features:**

   - Use location-based filtering for windmills.
   - Train models using labeled green areas and isolated locations.

5. **Post-Processing:**

   - Filter and merge detections using thresholding and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
   - Align detections with original image coordinates.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Create interactive dashboards with Streamlit.
   - Develop RESTful APIs with Flask.
   - Deploy applications on Heroku.
   - Use PostgreSQL for database management and GitHub for version control.
